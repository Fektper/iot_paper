In this section I will examine several open source solutions that provide a Trusted Execution Environment. I will look at implementations spanning different Hardware Architectures like Sancus (on MSP430) \cite{sancus}, Sanctum \cite{sanctum_paper}, Keystone \cite{keystone_paper}, TIMBER-V \cite{timber-v} (on RISC-V), Komodo \cite{Komodo}, OP-TEE \cite{optee_notrealpaper}(ARM TrustZone) and MyTEE (mainly software based)

I will discuss key differences in their design and implementation, which lead to different scope of their provided protections. For this I will take into consideration the different aspects that previous surveys on the topic of Trusted Execution Environments focussed on \cite{Maene2018} \cite{tee_whatitis}, but will also try to capture new aspects, should they arise.
