In this section I will discuss the main technical aspects regarding trusted execution environments. For this, I will not only discuss open source solutions but also have a look at the approaches of proprietary implementations.

I will introduce important concepts for the understanding of TEE's, like Secure Boot, Secure Storage, Trusted I/O and remote attestation and how they can be achieved/ensured by a combination of hardware and software.

I will examine how defining different Threat Models leads to different requirements for Trusted Execution Environments. As an example, Intel SGX with its lack of side channel attack protection could be used.
