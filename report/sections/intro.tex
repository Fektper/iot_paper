\IEEEPARstart{M}{otivation} for Trusted Execution Environments. I will define what they are and explain why they are needed. In particular, I will go over the need in the IoT space and focus not so much on consumer space, where the discussion about trusted execution is, at least partially, controversive.


I will also discuss the advantages of relying on open-source solutions compared to closed source. Here, I will probably take the example of Intel SGX (now deprecated for consumer CPUs), where there was initially not so much known about the exact details of its implementation, but over time several exploits (e.g. \cite{sgxspectre} \cite{plundervolt}) came to light. This showcases, that one can not simply trust a Trusted Execution Environment without being able to reason about its design and implementation choices, even when they are proprietary and coming from a large cooperation.
